## Introduction
In this experiment, I'm using my laptop with the processor Intel® Core™ i5-5300U × 4, and i have changed my stack maximuim memory to more then 200Mo (204800Kb to be exact) so it could stand the largest dataset.

## Bubble sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed, unil the whole array in sorted, 
and thus it's time complexity in O(n²).

## Selection sort
Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list,
and it's time complexity is also O(n²).

## Insertion sort
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration and it's time complexity is O(n²).
